# Assignment

- Create a prototype application

- Create a project based on data visualization using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) or R (ggplot2, Shiny, etc.).

## Datasets

You can use any dataset of your choice. Here are some suggestions:

 - [Polity dataset](https://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html)
 - [Gapminder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
 - [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
 
 
 ## Report

 - Write a cogent report on your project. The report should include a narrative that explains the insights derived from the project and visualizations.

 - A prototype

## Hints & quick checklist

* Start with a clear scenario and a paper prototype before coding.
* Keep scope small: a single, well-polished interaction beats many half-built features.
* Prioritize explainability and uncertainty over fancy visuals.
* Test early with real people and iterate.
